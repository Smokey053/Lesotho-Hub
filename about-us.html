                <h2>About Lesotho Hub</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Lesotho Hub was founded in 2025 to connect local farmers with customers across the country. Since our launch, we have worked directly with smallholder farmers, cooperatives, and local markets to build reliable channels for selling fresh produce and other agricultural products. We prioritise practical support such as improving post-harvest handling, sharing market price information, and helping producers present their goods to a wider audience.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>To support Lesotho's agricultural sector by providing a platform for farmers to showcase their products and reach more customers. We deliver this through simple digital tools, farmer training sessions, and local market linkages that make it easier to find buyers and secure fair prices. We also collaborate with extension services and community groups to share best practices in soil health, pest management, and sustainable water use.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>A thriving agricultural community where every farmer has equal opportunity to succeed. We envision resilient rural livelihoods supported by fair markets, climate-smart farming methods, and stronger cooperative networks. Over time we aim to increase access to finance, improve storage and transport options, and engage young people with training so the next generation can build profitable, sustainable farms across Lesotho.</p>

                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>Lesotho Hub began as a grassroots initiative led by a group of extension officers and farmers who recognised the need for better market linkages. Early pilot projects focused on three districts and tested simple market bulletin boards, group sales and shared transport for produce. Positive results led to wider adoption and the formation of the Hub as a central point for training, information sharing and market coordination.</p>

                <h3>Team & Partners</h3>
                <p>Our team includes agricultural extension specialists, market advisers and community coordinators who work directly with farmer groups. We partner with local cooperatives, NGOs and government agencies to deliver training and match supply with demand.
