                    <h3>Pricing Your Products</h3>
                    <p>Research what similar products are selling for in your area. Consider your costs and a reasonable profit margin.</p>
                    <p>To set a fair and competitive price, follow these steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Calculate all production costs (inputs, labour, transport, packaging).</li>
                        <li>Add a target profit margin that reflects your effort and local demand.</li>
                        <li>Survey local markets and online listings to see where your product fits.</li>
                        <li>Account for seasonality, spoilage, and discounts for bulk or repeat customers.</li>
                        <li>Test prices, collect customer feedback, and adjust as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Keep clear records of costs and sales so you can review and update pricing regularly.</p>
                    <p>Use a simple spreadsheet or mobile bookkeeping app to track inputs, labour, transport, packaging and sales. Record date, product, quantity, unit cost and total revenue for each transaction.</p>
                </article>

                    <h3>Marketing Locally</h3>
                    <p>Small, low-cost marketing can increase visibility and sales. Start with clear signage at market stalls, labelled packaging and short product descriptions that state origin and freshness.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Offer tasting samples where possible to showcase quality.</li>
                        <li>Use WhatsApp or local groups to announce availability and special offers.</li>
                        <li>Partner with nearby businesses (shops, restaurants) for steady orders.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Track which channels bring orders and focus resources there.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Storage and Post-harvest Handling</h3>
                    <p>Reducing loss after harvest directly improves income. Simple measures like drying produce correctly, using clean storage crates, and cooling perishable items quickly extend shelf life.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sort and grade produce to separate damaged items.</li>
                        <li>Store in ventilated, shaded places; avoid direct sun.</li>
                        <li>Use low-cost evaporative coolers or insulated boxes for short-term cooling.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Regularly inspect stored produce and move older stock to sales channels first.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Customer Relationships</h3>
                    <p>Building trust with your customers leads to repeat business. Always deliver what you promise. Keep communication clear about quantities, quality and delivery dates.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collect simple feedback after sales to improve service.</li>
                        <li>Offer a small loyalty incentive for repeat buyers.</li>
                        <li>Be transparent about product availability during season changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Online Presence</h3>
                    <p>Even a simple online profile can help you reach more customers. Keep your information up to date and use photos that show your product clearly.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Post consistent photos and short descriptions of stock.</li>
                        <li>Respond quickly to inquiries and confirm order details.</li>
                        <li>Consider adding delivery or pick-up instructions to listings.</li>
                    </ul>
